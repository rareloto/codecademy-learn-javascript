## **[Kelvin Weather](https://www.codecademy.com/courses/introduction-to-javascript/projects/kelvin-weather-javascript)**

Deep in his mountain-side meteorology lab, the mad scientist Kelvin has mastered weather prediction.

Recently, Kelvin began publishing his weather forecasts on his website. However there’s a problem: All of his forecasts describe the temperature in [Kelvin](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kelvin).

With our knowledge of JavaScript, let’s convert Kelvin to Celsius, then to Fahrenheit.

Sample output:


```
Today's temperature is 93 degrees Fahrenheit.
307.15 K
= 34 degrees Celsius
= 93 degrees Fahrenheit
= 11 degrees Newton
```
